# 1K macro (2015)

Tags: code-golf, js1k

I only have vague memories of working on this, but it looks like some kind of
simple macro language for making minified code, and that I was hoping to use it
for JS1K 2015

Some interesting files:

- [A macro](bin/grid-demo.1k)
- [A macro library](lib/tile-engine.1k)
- [You can click to change the tiles apparently](tmp/grid-fullscreen.html)
- [parser?](1k.js)
- [another build script called v2?](v2/1k.js)
