# 1K macro (2015)

I only have vague memories of working on this, but it looks like some kind of
simple macro language for making minified code, and that I was hoping to use it
for [JS1K 2015](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/)

Some interesting files:

- [A macro](bin/grid-demo.1k)
- [Macro library](lib/tile-engine.1k)
- [parser?](1k.js)
- [another parser called v2?](v2/1k.js)
