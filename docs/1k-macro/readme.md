# 1K macro (2015)

I only have vague memories of working on this, but it looks like some kind of
simple macro language for making minified code, and that I was hoping to use it
for [JS1K 2015](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/)

[Live Demo](livedemo.html)

Some interesting files:

- [Macro library](//github.com/nrkn/research-prototypes/blob/main/projects/1k-macro/lib/tile-engine.1k)
- [parser?](//github.com/nrkn/research-prototypes/blob/main/projects/1k-macro/1k.js)
- [another parser called v2?](//github.com/nrkn/research-prototypes/blob/main/projects/1k-macro/v2/1k.js)
